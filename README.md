## About
This project presents the redesign of the web user interface for the
FRI Urnik application used at the Faculty of Computer and Infor
mation Science, University Ljubljana. The redesign process was
grounded in a user-centered design approach and informed by a
comprehensive analysis of user needs and behaviors. We employed
qualitative methods, including persona creation and user journey
mapping, to better understand key usage scenarios and pain points.
In addition, a user survey was conducted to collect requirements
and expectations regarding schedule management. Existing solu
tions, such as Google Calendar and eAsistent, were analyzed to
identify relevant design patterns and best practices. Based on these
insights, initial concepts were explored through paper prototyping,
followed by the development of two high-fidelity prototypes: a
mobile version and a desktop version, both implemented in Figma.
The resulting designs aim to improve usability, clarity, and accessi
bility of the scheduling interface while better supporting the daily
workflows of students and staff.
